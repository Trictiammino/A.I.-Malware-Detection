# A.I.-Malware-Detection

Training of three models to detect malware.

The three models are:
1) Decision Tree
2) Random Forest
3) K-Nearest-Neighbor

Each model went through a phase to explore and find the best parameter configuration. In this phase
each model used 2 different methods for feature selection:
1) Mutual Information
2) PCA

The dataset used to train the models is a subset of EMBER DATASET (https://github.com/elastic/ember)
