# A.I.-Malware-Detection

Training of three models to detect malware.
The dataset used to train the models is a subset of EMBER DATASET (https://github.com/elastic/ember)

The three models are:
1) Decision Tree
2) Random Forest
3) K-Nearest-Neighbor

Each model went through a phase to explore and find the best parameter configuration. In this phase
each model used 2 different methods for feature selection:
1) Mutual Information
2) PCA

At the end of the search for the best parameter configuration, an ensamble model was also created based on the configurations found. 

The accuracy of the trained models ranges between 82 and 96%
